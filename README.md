## <samp>Introduction</samp>
<samp>Traditional robotic vacuum cleaners often encounter challenges when navigating around obstacles such as jwellery, faeces , leading to inefficient cleaning and potential collisions. To address these limitations, this project combines  YOLO object detection and localization algorithm in addition to the Lidar technology to enhance the robot's ability to detect and avoid obstacles with high accuracy.<br>
Moreover, the project goes beyond simple obstacle avoidance by implementing a complete path coverage algorithm. This algorithm generates optimal cleaning paths, ensuring that the robotic vacuum cleaner covers the entire cleaning area systematically and efficiently. The project also includes a real-time monitoring module, which provides visual feedback on the cleaning process, obstacle detection, and path coverage progress.<br> 
By leveraging the capabilities of YOLO, Lidar, and the CPP algorithm, the project aims to improvise the obstacle avoidance which inturn would improve the efficiency of the robot in cleaning spaces.</samp>

## <samp>Architecture Overview</samp>
<samp>
  
- <b>Perception:</b> The perception component utilizes various sensors such as cameras, Lidar sensors, and ultrasonic sensors to perceive the environment and gather data about the surroundings. These sensors provide crucial information for obstacle detection, localization, and mapping.

- <b>Obstacle Detection and Mapping:</b> The obstacle detection and mapping module process the sensor data and utilize algorithms like YOLO and Lidar processing techniques to detect and classify obstacles in real-time. This information is then used to create a map of the environment, marking obstacle locations and their characteristics.

- <b>Path Planning:</b> The path planning component takes into account the obstacle map generated by the perception module and generates an optimal cleaning path. Coverage Path algorithm to determine an efficient route that covers the entire cleaning area while avoiding obstacles.

- <b>Control:</b> The control module receives the planned cleaning path and generates control commands for the robotic vacuum cleaner's actuators. These commands include instructions for motor control, steering, and speed adjustments to ensure accurate and precise movement along the planned path.

- <b>Localization:</b> Localization plays a crucial role in accurately determining the robotic vacuum cleaner's position and orientation within the cleaning environment. By utilizing sensor data, mapping information, and advanced localization techniques, the system can estimate the robot's pose in real-time, enhancing navigation accuracy.

- <b>User Interface:</b> The user interface component provides an interactive platform for users to monitor and configure the Enhanced Obstacle Avoidance System. It allows users to visualize the cleaning progress, view obstacle detection results, and adjust system settings as needed.
